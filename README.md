 * Library of priority queue. The implementations of priority queue in `dpu/libpqueue` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h are modified to suit the demands of UPMEM from the implementation here: https://github.com/vy/libpqueue
 * MSR fetching. The implementations of `rdmsr` and related functions in `host/measureEnergy.c` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h for energy measurement are modified from the implementation here: https://github.com/lixiaobai09/intel_power_consumption_get/blob/master/powerget.c
