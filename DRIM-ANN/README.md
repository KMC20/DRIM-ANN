# DRIM-ANN
## Dependency
* The faiss library: integrated to the cluster locating phase on CPU. Install by conda at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
  
To avoid dependency on faiss, this repo provides a version without faiss as well. You can try this by replacing the folder `host` by `hostNoFaiss`, and replacing `Makefile` by `Makefile.noFaiss`. This version supports hyperthreading and AVX2 by default, and you can change the use of `knn_L2sqr` into `knn_L2sqrAVX512` in `host/tools/src/tools.cpp` and the `CXXFLAGS` in `Makefile.noFaiss` into the annotated one if your machine supports AVX512. However, the implementation has not been deeply optimized, so it is 2~4 times slower than the faiss implementation, especially in cases that `nlist` is large.
## Index & query data
1. Browse the cloud storage link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/17qbkuQC80EE0dE_SDdljrA
2. Input the extracting code: cv43
3. Download the whole data folder and move it to the local folder.
## How to test
Make sure that index & query data have been downloaded and placed in this folder. Then execute the following commands:
```
mv data/* ./
rmdir data
mkdir build
mkdir -p ckpts/SIFT100M
mkdir ckpts/DEEP100M
make run
```
## How to check the results
Check the log and top-k neighbor files in the `build` and `ckpts` folders respectively. Please refer to the Appendix of Artifact Description/Artifact Evaluation of the SC2025 article for more details.
## Thanks
 * Library of priority queue. The implementations of priority queue in `dpu/libpqueue` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h are modified to suit the demands of UPMEM from the implementation here: https://github.com/vy/libpqueue
 * MSR fetching. The implementations of `rdmsr` and related functions in `host/measureEnergy.c` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h for energy measurement are modified from the implementation here: https://github.com/lixiaobai09/intel_power_consumption_get/blob/master/powerget.c
 * The basic directory structure of the repo is learned from the upmemGCiM project: https://github.com/KMC20/upmemGCiM
 * The faiss library: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
 * SIFT dataset: http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr
 * DEEP dataset: https://research.yandex.com/blog/benchmarks-for-billion-scale-similarity-search
