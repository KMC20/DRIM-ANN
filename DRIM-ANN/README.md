# DRIM-ANN
## Dependency
* The faiss library: integrated to the cluster locating phase on CPU. Install by conda at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss
  To avoid dependency on faiss, this repo also provides a version without faiss. You can replace the folder `host` by `hostNoFaiss`, and replace `Makefile` by `Makefile.noFaiss`. This version supports hyperthreading and AVX2 by default, and you can change the use of `knn_L2sqr` into `knn_L2sqrAVX512` in `host/tools/src/tools.cpp` and the `CXXFLAGS` into the annotated one in `Makefile.noFaiss` if your machine supports AVX512. However, the implementation has not been deeply optimized, so it is 2~4 times slower than the faiss implementation, especially in cases that `nlist` is large.
## How to test
```
unzip -q data.zip
rm data.zip
mkdir build
mkdir -p ckpts/SIFT100M
mkdir -p ckpts/DEEP100M
make run
```
## How to check the results
Please refer to the Appendix of Artifact Description/Artifact Evaluation of the SC2025 article.
## Thanks
 * Library of priority queue. The implementations of priority queue in `dpu/libpqueue` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h are modified to suit the demands of UPMEM from the implementation here: https://github.com/vy/libpqueue
 * MSR fetching. The implementations of `rdmsr` and related functions in `host/measureEnergy.c` in UPMEM_d and UPMEM_h for energy measurement are modified from the implementation here: https://github.com/lixiaobai09/intel_power_consumption_get/blob/master/powerget.c
 * The basic directory structure of the repo is learned from the upmemGCiM project: https://github.com/KMC20/upmemGCiM
